Timber
------

Timber is awesome, it can make `Log` to be a happy stuff!

You also won't miss [Pidcat](http://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat/) !

So, why this library exists:
> JakeWharton ([Minimum SDK · Issue #98 · JakeWharton/timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber/issues/98))
No one has given a compelling argument other than "because you can". Why
should support be added for this API level no one is using?

Usage
-----

Two easy steps:

 1. Install any `Tree` instances you want in the `onCreate` of your application class.
 2. Call `Timber`'s static methods everywhere throughout your app.

Check out the sample app in `timber-sample/` to see it in action.
